```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
set.seed(42) # Setting seed for reproduceability 
population <- tibble(
  age=sample(18:80,1000, replace = TRUE)

)
head(population)
```
```{r}
sample_100 <- population |> 
  sample_n(100)

sample_50 <- population |> 
  sample_n(50)

sample_10 <- population |> 
  sample_n(10)
```

```{r}
sample_100 |> summarize(mean=mean(age), sd=sd(age))
sample_50 |> summarize(mean=mean(age), sd=sd(age))
sample_10 |> summarize(mean=mean(age), sd=sd(age))
                      

```
```{r}
population |> summarize(mean=mean(age), sd=sd(age))
```

The means are not very similar, but the standard deviations are similar. This is important because standard deviation is the variety of responses we are getting. We want to have a smaller survey size with the same amount of variety, which we do here-even with the sample size of 10.
